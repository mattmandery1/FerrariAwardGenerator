Note: Included in this folder is "FCA Class results.xls" which was used as a template in the development of this program.  The Column name headers are VERY important and CANNOT change
if the program is to run as intended. 

Expected header output: 
FirstName	LastName	FCAMemberNumber	Address	City	State	ZIP	Email	RegisterNumberofFerraris	Ferrari1	Year1	Model1	SerialNumber1	BodyStyle1	Coachbuilder1	CarColor1


There can be NO spaces in column names in this version of the application. 

To set up a new excel document to use: 
1) Make sure the column names match those above. 
2) Ensure data is on first sheet of the excel document, and no other sheets exist.
	a) No special naming of excel workbook or sheet is required. 


Output: 
An pdf file of result score sheet will appear on desktop. It will be titled "<Name of scoring class entered on first screen>.pdf" If needed to generate again, delete orig. off desktop and re-run. 


Developer note: If column names match above but data is not being pulled in correctly, I recommend you copy all records in workbook, right click -> Format Cells -> Text.
